# 📝 Project Overview
Throughout this thesis, we embed small, tricky code patterns—“atoms of confusion” (AOCs)—inside Java snippets. Each snippet hides one atom (e.g., omitted braces, pre/post‐increment, boolean precedence, change‐of‐literal‐encoding, bitwise operations). Participants must fill in the blank(s) to reconstruct the exact confusing pattern. We then validate whether the reconstruction is correct by checking both final variable values and side‐effects.

## Key objectives:

Measure Cloze Accuracy: Determine how often each atom is correctly predicted.

Collect Demographics: Record participant experience (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

Analyze Results: Compare error rates, time to completion, and patterns of misunderstanding.
